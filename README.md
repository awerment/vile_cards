# VileCards
## A terrible online version of Cards Against HumanityÂ®

Unnecessarily built with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and [Phoenix (LiveView)](https://www.phoenixframework.org) (LV part is yet to be added)

## Development

Yes. "Development". 

### Setup

  * Install Erlang and Elixir (use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com)), for versions ~~confirmed~~ assumed to work, see `./.tool-versions`)
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies

### Running the test suite

  * run `mix test` and hope for the best

### Running the local server 

(Will just show you the default, generated pages at the moment, so why bother?)

  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
  * Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
